# 12-Bit-Synchronous-Counter

This project presents a 12-bit synchronous counter designed to perform up/down counting operations based on a control signal. The counter incorporates several control inputs: Load, Up/Down, Reset, and Enable. When the Load signal is high, the counter will be loaded with a 12-bit value from the input bus data[11:0]. The Up/Down signal determines the direction of the count: up for high, down for low. The Reset signal forces the counter to zero. The Enable signal controls the overall operation of the counter, allowing it to be paused when low. The counter is driven by a clock signal and operates synchronously with the positive edge of the clock. This project includes directed and layered testbench design, synthesis optimization and physical design with PnR optimization of the designed 12-bit synchronous counter.
